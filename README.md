Stack Implementation in C++ 🚀

This project demonstrates a stack data structure implementation in C++ using arrays. 
The stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, supporting operations like push, pop, and peek.
📌 Features

✅ Push Operation – Adds an element to the stack 📥
✅ Pop Operation – Removes the top element 📤
✅ Peek Operation – Returns the top element without removing it 👀
✅ Encapsulation – Manages data securely inside a class 🔐
